## üìñ Gameplay Overview
1. The adventure to conquer the galaxy unfolds in turns:
2. Roll and Move: Start your turn by rolling the dice and moving your pawn across the galactic board. Rolling doubles lets you roll again, but three doubles in a row will land you in Jail!
3. Manage Properties: If you land on an unowned property, you can buy it. If it‚Äôs owned by another player, you must pay them rent. Collect full sets of colored properties to increase their value.
4. Build Structures: Once you own a full color-set of properties, you can build up to four "Bases" (houses). After that, you can upgrade them into a single, powerful "Mega Base" (hotel) to maximize the rent you collect.
5. Handle Special Events: Landing on a "Chance" or "Community" square will require you to draw a card and follow its instructions‚Äîthese can be good or bad!
6. Avoid Bankruptcy: The goal is to stay financially solvent. If you owe more money than you have, you are declared bankrupt and are out of the game. The last player standing wins!
